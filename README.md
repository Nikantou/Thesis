# Thesis
This repository is used to list all subparts of the programming work that I performed during the work on my thesis at the Medical Faculty of the University of Tuebingen, the Friedrich-Miescher Laboratory of the Max Planck Society, and the University of Konstanz

I will structure this repository based on the local documentation system that I established for the work on my projects. Thus, all the title names here should correspond to directories on the local PC. Please note that I can update small files here, large files I will have to store locally.

The stated work periods correspond to the time periods when I concentrated on this work. This explicitly does not exclude work on the respective projects done after the stated periods.

## Work packages
### 1. Datasets
Due to the size of the datasets, for now I have to store the data files on GOR and locally.

### 2. Deep_learning

This is the original beginning of my work about analysis of developmental robustness during embryogenesis. Following, the subdirectories of this directory are listed with a brief explanation about their purpose.

#### 2.1 01_BBox_Segmentation
Work period: 2020/11 - 2021/08  <br>
This directory contains code for the training and testing of a segmentation network for zebrafish embryos. Also, with this network, I created a GUI for the segmentation of datasets.

#### 2.2 02_Rotation_Classification
Work period: 2021/01 - 2021/03  <br>
This repository contains code to assess embryonic rotations with a classification algorithm into three planes: frontal, transversal, saggital. This code experimented with in silico 3D models.

#### 2.3 03_Developmental_stage_classification
Work period: 2021/02 - 2021/09  <br>
This directory experiments wit a classification algorithm for detection of developmental stages.

#### 2.4 04_GAN
Work period: 2021/02 - 2021/03  <br>
This directory contains experimental code for the use of Generative Adversarial Networks on zebrafish embryogenesis.

#### 2.5 05_Embryo_Segmentation
Work period: 2021/02 - 2021/04  <br>
In this project, I created a model that uses a MaskRCNN for semantic segmentation of zebrafish embryos in the blastula stage.
