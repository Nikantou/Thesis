# Thesis
This repository is used to list all subparts of the programming work that I performed during the work on my thesis at the Medical Faculty of the University of Tuebingen, the Friedrich-Miescher Laboratory of the Max Planck Society, and the University of Konstanz

I will structure this repository based on the local documentation system that I established for the work on my projects. Thus, all the title names here should correspond to directories on the local PC. Please note that I can update small files here, large files I will have to store locally.

## Work packages
### 1. Datasets
Due to the size of the datasets, for now I have to store the data files on GOR and locally.

### 2. Deep_learning
This is the original beginning of my work about analysis of developmental robustness during embryogenesis. Following, the subdirectories of this directory are listed with a brief explanation about their purpose.

#### 2.1 01_BBox_Segmentation
This directory contains code for the training and testing of a segmentation network for zebrafish embryos. Also, with this network, I created a GUI for the segmentation of datasets.

#### 2.2 02_Rotation_Classification
This repository contains code to assess embryonic rotations with a classification algorithm into three planes: frontal, transversal, saggital.

#### 2.3 03_Developmental_stage_classification
#### 2.4 04_GAN
#### 2.5 05_Embryo_Segmentation
#### 2.6 06_Unsupervised_Classification_PCA_KMEANS
#### 2.7 07_Fertilization_classification
#### 2.8 08_Pix2Pix
#### 2.9 09_Variational_autoencoder
#### 2.10 10_Defect_classification
#### 2.11 11_Keypoint_detection

### 3. Deep_learning_2
### 4. Deep_learning_3
### 5. Deep_learning_4
